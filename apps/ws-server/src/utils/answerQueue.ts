/**
 * Buffered writer for answer submissions.
 *
 * A question closing sends every participant's answer within a second or two.
 * Written one at a time that is three database round trips each — insert the
 * answer, increment the score, count how many have answered — so 750 people
 * meant well over two thousand operations competing for a connection pool of
 * 25. Past roughly 500 participants the pool could not keep up and Prisma
 * started rejecting transactions with "Unable to start a transaction in the
 * given time": a third of answers were silently dropped, with the participant
 * seeing their choice highlighted and no points for it.
 *
 * Buffering turns that burst into a handful of bulk statements. 750 answers
 * become roughly eight flushes of two statements each, which the pool handles
 * comfortably.
 *
 * The cost is that an answer is durable a fraction of a second after it is
 * acknowledged rather than immediately. Everything that reads answers goes
 * through `countAnswered` below, which adds the rows still in the buffer, so
 * nothing downstream can observe the gap.
